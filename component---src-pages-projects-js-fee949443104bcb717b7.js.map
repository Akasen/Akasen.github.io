In my groups case, we found ourselves working\r\n          with the school itself.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The idea brought to us was simple: create a tool that would allow\r\n          students to have a better understanding where they were academically\r\n          with regards to their courses in an attempt to help improve graduation\r\n          rates. A fantastic example is with regards to dropping a course, as\r\n          certain courses are only offered during certain semesters, so a\r\n          student should be made more aware of this fact before dropping a\r\n          course so they don't drop something they will now have to wait\r\n          essentially a year to retake.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>This project was developed using Microsoft ASP.NET Core.</p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This project was probably one of the more complicated projects I had\r\n          ever done all things considered. While I had some experience in\r\n          working on Ruby on Rails before, I had never had to work on something\r\n          with the scope of this project. Admittedly, my group as a whole had\r\n          over-estimated the ease of the project we seemed to have and so we\r\n          ended up promising features to our client that wasn't even reasonable\r\n          for us considering our skills.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Overall, a major learning experience.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"showcase\">\r\n        <h1>\r\n          <a\r\n            href=\"https://github.com/Akasen/2020-Gatsby-Homepage\"\r\n            target=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n          >\r\n            This Website\r\n          </a>\r\n        </h1>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This homepage has been quite the learning experience so far. I've\r\n          remade it many times over the years, but this current iteration I'm\r\n          taking more active steps in learning some tools.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This iteration was originally just made in basic HTML and CSS, but\r\n          then I realized it was a perfect opportunity to take what I had there\r\n          and use them as a way to guide me in the creation of a basic Gatsby\r\n          website.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I'm so far happy with the results so far, and have in a short time\r\n          learned a great deal about Gatsby and gained a better basic\r\n          understanding of ReactJS.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"showcase\">\r\n        <h1>\"The NodeJS/ExpressJS That Serves This Site\"</h1>\r\n        <p>\r\n          It's not really a major feat, probably. But if I had to at least be\r\n          honest, it is an accomplishment on my end to decide \"I'm gonna delete\r\n          apache just to see if I can build a basic node backend that serves my\r\n          static website\".\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I'd wager most university students that would have gone through the\r\n          university track alone wouldn't have ever thought to do this in their\r\n          spare time.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>But I did it because I was curious.</p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          It is a bit of a learning experience though to be honest, as normally\r\n          most servers one can get off the internet tend to have apache or nginx\r\n          already installed, and I assume installing either from the package\r\n          manager of any given Linux distribution would also have things\r\n          somewhat setup.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I say this because I had to deal with actually learning how to make my\r\n          webserver run at all times, even after a system reboot. Although it\r\n          took me a bit because for some reason looking this up in relation to\r\n          Node kept giving me answers about \"forever\" (a node application or\r\n          something) or \"nohup\", the latter being a seemingly alright solution.\r\n          Until I learned about systemd.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I'll have to figure out what the better question I should have been\r\n          asking Google should have been, cause I almost was about to venture\r\n          into using \"forever\", which likely is no longer maintained.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Projects\r\n","import React from \"react\"\r\n\r\nconst Main = ({ children }) => {\r\n  return <div class=\"main\">{children}</div>\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Main\r\n","import React from \"react\"\r\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\"\r\nimport profile from \"../images/profile.jpg\"\r\nimport \"./navbar.css\"\r\n\r\nconst Navbar = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"navbar\">\r\n      <Link to=\"/\">\r\n        <img class=\"profilepic\" src={profile} />\r\n      </Link>\r\n      <ul class=\"navlinks\">\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Link to=\"/projects\">Projects</Link>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/akasen\" target=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n            Github\r\n          </a>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Navbar\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/profile-858804dbd3eccfa0532936b18ac4d11b.jpg\";","import React from \"react\"\r\nimport Navbar from \"./Navbar\"\r\nimport Main from \"./Main\"\r\nimport \"./layout.css\"\r\n\r\nconst Layout = ({ children }) => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n      <Navbar></Navbar>\r\n      <Main>{children}</Main>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Layout\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
