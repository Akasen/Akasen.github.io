A fantastic example is with regards to dropping a course, as\r\n          certain courses are only offered during certain semesters, so a\r\n          student should be made more aware of this fact before dropping a\r\n          course so they don't drop something they will now have to wait\r\n          essentially a year to retake.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>This project was developed using Microsoft ASP.NET Core.</p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This project was probably one of the more complicated projects I had\r\n          ever done all things considered.

But if I had to at least be\r\n          honest, it is an accomplishment on my end to decide \"I'm gonna delete\r\n          apache just to see if I can build a basic node backend that serves my\r\n          static website\".\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I'd wager most university students that would have gone through the\r\n          university track alone wouldn't have ever thought to do this in their\r\n          spare time.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>But I did it because I was curious.</p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          It is a bit of a learning experience though to be honest, as normally\r\n          most servers one can get off the internet tend to have apache or nginx\r\n          already installed, and I assume installing either from the package\r\n          manager of any given Linux distribution would also have things\r\n          somewhat setup.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I say this because I had to deal with actually learning how to make my\r\n          webserver run at all times, even after a system reboot. Although it\r\n          took me a bit because for some reason looking this up in relation to\r\n          Node kept giving me answers about \"forever\" (a node application or\r\n          something) or \"nohup\", the latter being a seemingly alright solution.\r\n          Until I learned about systemd.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I'll have to figure out what the better question I should have been\r\n          asking Google should have been, cause I almost was about to venture\r\n          into using \"forever\", which likely is no longer maintained.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Projects\r\n","import React from \"react\"\r\n\r\nconst Main = ({ children }) => {\r\n  return <div class=\"main\">{children}</div>\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Main\r\n","import React from \"react\"\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\nimport Link, {\n  withPrefix,\n  withAssetPrefix,\n  navigate,\n  push,\n  replace,\n  navigateTo,\n  parsePath,\n} from \"gatsby-link\"\nimport PageRenderer from \"./public-page-renderer\"\nimport loader from \"./loader\"\n\nconst prefetchPathname = loader.enqueue\n\nconst StaticQueryContext = React.createContext({})\n\nfunction StaticQueryDataRenderer({ staticQueryData, data, query, render }) {\n  const finalData = data\n    ? data.data\n    : staticQueryData[query] && staticQueryData[query].data\n\n  return (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      {finalData && render(finalData)}\n      {!finalData && <div>Loading (StaticQuery)</div>}\n    </React.Fragment>\n  )\n}\n\nconst StaticQuery = props => {\n  const { data, query, render, children } = props\n\n  return (\n    <StaticQueryContext.Consumer>\n      {staticQueryData => (\n        <StaticQueryDataRenderer\n          data={data}\n          query={query}\n          render={render || children}\n          staticQueryData={staticQueryData}\n        />\n      )}\n    </StaticQueryContext.Consumer>\n  )\n}\n\nconst useStaticQuery = query => {\n  if (\n    typeof React.useContext !== `function` &&\n    process.env.NODE_ENV === `development`\n  ) {\n    throw new Error(\n      `You're likely using a version of React that doesn't support Hooks\\n` +\n        `Please update React and ReactDOM to 16.8.0 or later to use the useStaticQuery hook.`\n    )\n  }\n  const context = React.useContext(StaticQueryContext)\n  if (context[query] && context[query].data) {\n    return context[query].data\n  } else {\n    throw new Error(\n      `The result of this StaticQuery could not be fetched.\\n\\n` +\n        `This is likely a bug in Gatsby and if refreshing the page does not fix it, ` +\n        `please open an issue in https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues`\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nStaticQuery.propTypes = {\n  data: PropTypes.object,\n  query: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n  render: PropTypes.func,\n  children: PropTypes.func,\n}\n\nfunction graphql() {\n  throw new Error(\n    `It appears like Gatsby is misconfigured.
