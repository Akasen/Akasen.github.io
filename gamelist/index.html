You found this page! Or you&#x27;re on my github</h1><div><p>So basically I don&#x27;t know what to title this page in the navigation. &quot;Fave-Games&quot; is too long, and &quot;Games&quot; implies I actually developed a game. But this is a list of games I&#x27;ve played and my thoughts on them</p><p>I apologize for the poor styling up here, I don&#x27;t care too much about that right now.</p></div><div class="showcase"><h1>DUSK</h1><p>I played this game right after beating DOOM Eternal, and I gotta admit that I&#x27;m torn on whether I enjoy DUSK more than either of the nu-DOOM&#x27;s.</p><p>It&#x27;s a damn shame though that the multiplayer for the game is dead, least as far as I can tell.</p></div><div class="showcase"><h1>DOOM Eternal</h1><p>Still good fun though, you can not at all deny that.</p><p>The current debate as to whether DOOM Eternal or DOOM (2016) is better is an annoying one to look at though, but the fact I&#x27;d choose DUSK over DOOM (2016) and debate on DOOM Eternal vs DUSK should at least put into perspective where I stand on the debate.</p><p>Thing is, DOOM Eternal just really is a game about skill. Early on, everyone had isues with the Marauder fight, but within like two weeks, people had already taught you how to turn him into gibs using this lovely technique called &quot;swap between super shotgun and ballista&quot;, and suddenly he&#x27;s just a boring fight.</p><p>I can partly get the preference for DOOM (2016), it&#x27;s very Doom 1 and 2 in that it gives you a lot of weapons and ways to kill a monster, but you can get away with only the super shotgun for everything and be fine.</p><p>The realm of DOOM Eternal is to be using weapons with maximum efficiency as much as possible. But honestly, I&#x27;d just make sure to chainsaw something whenever possible. I honestly feel like if you play enough of Eternal, a portion of it becomes mindless muscle memory.</p><p>The keybindings though are giving me grievance though in that I don&#x27;t know what to rebind some keys to at the moment. I don&#x27;t exactly have an MMO gaming mouse, and I&#x27;m not really use to usisng my mouse buttons in an FPS to switch weapons like that anyways.</p><p>Personally though, I do get a bit tired after any particular level of Eternal, and I don&#x27;t know why.</p></div><div class="showcase"><h1>Hacknet</h1><p>Consider this an honorable mention of a game in a way, I have horribly mixed feelings about Hacknet. You absolutely have to go into this game knowing it&#x27;s a story driven game that uses the whole hacking deal as a way to deliver that plot.</p><p>So you have this problem where this game isn&#x27;t really about simulating what it would be like to be a hacker, which is an extreme letdown if that was what you were looking for.</p><p>The plots kind of meh as well in a way, but I may be horribly colored by playing this game on and off for years before finally going through it in one go and being like &quot;Wait, this wasn&#x27;t that long.&quot; with a bit of embarassment. It&#x27;s at most a five hour experience.</p><p>The DLC is actually sort of better in this one weird regard just because of the actual ending of the DLC had some high stakes to it. I&#x27;m fairly certain I missed what the Hacknet OS was exactly and why it was so bad. It&#x27;s something to do about being &quot;Extremely secure&quot;, but honestly why is that an issue? Maybe I missed a bit about it being surveillance software or that it could control the population if used incorrectly.</p><p>I dunno, maybe this is just an issue of me kind of being concerned about privacy, the usage of Free and Open Source Software, and all that. Maybe the author didn&#x27;t really think much of the plot through or just wanted to tell an interesting story about a dead guy.</p><p>But speaking of maybe being too expereinced on my end, it really irks me that I can&#x27;t do &quot;rm -rf /&quot; on a system in this game or any variation of that. Like seriously, last mission of this game would have been so much easier if I could do that. But I guess it would have been hilariously anti-climactic to have happen as Carptenter Brut&#x27;s &quot;Roller Mobster&quot; blares in your ears.</p><p>Like seriously, imagine a movie where the the climax is just the dude doing that number to some critical computer and that&#x27;s just how some shadow organization falls apart.</p></div><div class="showcase"><h1>Uplink / UplinkOS</h1><p>You thought you could try to find my email or something just to tell me about Uplink, did you? Well you better also send an apology for sending that message cause I have played Uplink and I love it.</p><p>Seriously, I would love to just helm a spiritual sucessor that just attempts to add more on top of the game while also keeping to some of the spirit of its aesthetic, even if a portion of it is because the game is from the early 2000s.</p><p>My only honest gripe with UplinkOS is that it does a smidge too much modernizing of the UI. Mind you, I also have trouble playing the original game just cause the UI gives me nothing but trouble, but the lack of hearing telephone dialing is such an oddly pleasant bit.</p><p>Like if I were to make a hacking game, but I was told I still had to keep in mind modern tech for some reason and not re-invent stuff, I&#x27;d just say that there&#x27;s actually a dark underbelly of the internet that essentially uses dial-up to do all their work.</p><p>But asides from me gushing over the game by fawning over some imaginary successor, I honestly have an issue with progression in this game in that it&#x27;s actually very easy to acquire large amounts of money in this game pretty quickly if you just acquire a decent computer and tools early on and then hack a bank, note all the usernames and passwords, and go down the list taking money and hiding your steps until you find someone who has or has made a large transaction.</p><p>It&#x27;s not like this is some secret either, I basically was doing a mission where you trace a bank transfer and noticed that someone transferred a large sum of cash. So I noted it down, completed the mission, then stole the cash.</p><p>I have basically recovered from numerous screw ups by just repeating this process.</p><p>I think in a way though, the real answer is to create more money-sinks in some way shape or form. I wouldn&#x27;t know concretely what, but honestly something as dumb as some thing you invest in that makes more money is decent. Or actually, maybe hiring another hacker? Sky&#x27;s the limit</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/gamelist/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-7e4d7804df080eb8f631.js"],"app":["/app-0b94746114c01d72798f.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-412a11c66d1a255d4239.js"],"component---src-pages-components-layout-js":["/component---src-pages-components-layout-js-988b8ea1518a837ee14c.js"],"component---src-pages-components-main-js":["/component---src-pages-components-main-js-399182099fb98acaa469.js"],"component---src-pages-components-navbar-js":["/component---src-pages-components-navbar-js-dec6844d27b27e969429.js"],"component---src-pages-contact-js":["/component---src-pages-contact-js-23dbda84e415dbb36b43.js"],"component---src-pages-gamelist-js":["/component---src-pages-gamelist-js-0226e42e0b08e7874dd2.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-01a2cd590734aee45af7.js"],"component---src-pages-projects-js":["/component---src-pages-projects-js-d6ed3a39ceccd4fc259b.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-7e4d7804df080eb8f631.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-pages-gamelist-js-0226e42e0b08e7874dd2.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-407fe62976dc5310c43e.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-0b94746114c01d72798f.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-305b3707783ccc9d7ca6.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-e0bd30b38dd0cd8ccd4f.js" async=""></script></body></html>
